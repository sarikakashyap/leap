# Project Idea
#Medical Card for booking and prescription 
The introduction of technology into our daily lives has profoundly changed the way data is gathered, processed, stored, and evaluated. Data networks have long been an essential element of health-care systems in poor countries. Furthermore, as the population grows, the patient's trip through the healthcare system's many pathways will provide a significant challenge to patient data accountability, monitoring, recording, and analysis.Developing a model for collecting patient medical data from multiple health care contexts (e.g., family physicians, private clinics, emergency department visits, routes, and hospital systems) is critical, and it will necessitate additional storage capacity. The cloud database is a cost-effective way to create this application, and it includes features such as authentication and storage. Users are verified, and then their data is stored in a centralised database using mysql.This study also includes a Quick Response (QR) code for accessing patient-specific medical data through a smartphone smart card. The smart card will be used to share information with other health-care professionals and to make decisions more quickly. It assists in making appropriate judgments before to therapy by reviewing the patient's past medical data.
